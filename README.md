# Collatz Conjecture Sequence Plotter

This Python script calculates and plots the Collatz sequence for numbers from 1 to 500 using the 3n+1 conjecture.

## Description

The Collatz conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. It starts with any positive integer `n`, and at each step, if `n` is even, it is divided by 2, and if it's odd, it is multiplied by 3 and then increased by 1. The conjecture states that no matter what value of `n` you start with, you will always eventually reach the number 1.

This script calculates the Collatz sequence for numbers from 1 to 500 and plots the sequences. The goal is to visually observe how the sequence behaves for different initial values of `n`.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python library:
- `matplotlib`: Used for plotting the Collatz sequence.

You can install it using pip:

pip install matplotlib

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

    cd your-repo
3. Run the script:

   python collatz_sequence_plotter.py


The script will calculate and plot the Collatz sequence for numbers from 1 to 500.

## Example Output

Here is an example of what the script's output might look like:

Number: 1
Sequence: [1]

[Plot for Number 1](/path/to/plot_for_1.png)

Number: 2
Sequence: [2, 1]


[Plot for Number 2](/path/to/plot_for_2.png)
